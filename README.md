# BIGTREETECH-TMC2225-V1.0
The TMC2225 are ultra-silent motor driver ICs for two-phase stepper motors. Their pinning is compatible to a number of legacy drivers. TRINAMICs sophisticated StealthChop2 chopper ensures noiseless operation, maximum efficiency and best motor torque. Its fast current regulation and optional combination with SpreadCycle allow for highly dynamic motion. Integrated power-MOSFETs handle motor current up to 1.4A RMS. Protection and diagnostic features support robust and reliable operation. A simple to use UART interface opens up more tuning and control options. Application specific tuning can be stored to OTP memory. Industries’ most advanced STEP/DIR stepper motor driver family upgrades designs to noiseless and most precise operation for costeffective and highly competitive solutions.
